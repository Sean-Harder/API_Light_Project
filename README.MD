In this repository Im showing you the evolution of using LIFX's API to control my lights via my desktop. I am going to have seperate files with the different code, It started off with me just messing around with the API in visual stuido's trying to make it so when I run the code it will turn on the light(Messing_Around.py). After tinkering around with the API I started working on one of the main projects(Project_One_Code.py, Images_for_P1). I stopped working on that project, Like a month ago I started up a new version of P1, esencially they're both supposed to be like control hubs. This one I added weather and was trying to add spotify but I don't think the API works with tkinter.
