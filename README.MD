In this repository Im showing you the evolution of using LIFX's API to control my lights via my desktop. I am going to have seperate files with the different code, It started off with me just messing around with the API in visual stuido's trying to make it so when I run the code it will turn on the light(Messing_Around.py). After tinkering around with the API I started working on one of the main projects(Project_One_Code.py, Images_for_P1). 

In the second project I used a Weather API, the Old light code, and tried using the Spotify API (Will Adress Later). In Images_For_P2 you can look at what im explaining. At the top of the application it will take the json return from the weather api, and will sort throught it. It will start with changing the background and image depending on the weather, (snow, rain, sunny). It will find the tempature, location, humility, air pressure and display it. You can see the Json display text in Images_for_P2, Im still going to work on this project and try to add new things to it. The next is the light in the bottom right. Its basiaclly the same code I just made it smaller, you have the colors button, and the on and off button. In the bottom left I have all the buttons lined up and they all work I just needed to link it to the Spotify API, but from the documentaiton I looked at I needed to access the Auth through a website and don't think its possible to connect it to tkinter. (I'm still researching it)
